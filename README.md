# SCUD DEFENDER
## A Missile Command clone built using C++ and OpenGL!

Had some free time here from my classes. I always thought it would be cool to
dabble in a bit of OpenGL and expand my horizons a bit with C++. So, I decided
to make a modern copy of the classic Atari 2600 game Missile Command. 

My two primary goals in finishing this project include, demonstrating working 
knowledge of interception calculations for air defense systems, and to just
have some fun, I guess :P

If anyone else wants to clone this repository, go for it! Make a better
version or maybe use the code for something else!

## V1.0 In action!
