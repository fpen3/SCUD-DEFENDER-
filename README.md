##A Missile Command clone built using C++ and OpenGL!

Had some free time here from my classes. I always thought it would be cool to
dabble in a bit of OpenGL and expand my horizons a bit with C++. So, I decided
to make a modern copy of the classic Atari 2600 game Missile Command. 

### TO DO

* Complete observer mode
* Complete interactive mode
* Create a menu screen
